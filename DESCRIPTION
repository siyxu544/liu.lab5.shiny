Description: A web application built using the 'shiny' framework that provides 
    an interactive user interface for the 'liu.lab5.koladar' package. 
    The app enables users to explore data from the Swedish Kolada 
    database by allowing them to search and select Key Performance 
    Indicators (KPIs) and municipalities, specify a time period, and 
    view the results. Data is visualized as a time-series plot and 
    presented in an interactive table for detailed inspection.
